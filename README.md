- 👋 Hi, I’m Liz Dixon
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching curious students, reading about leadership, diversity & inclusion, feedback, communication styles, cognitive biases, heuristics, and how the brain works. A few of my mantras are these: If it kills you, you'll never have to do it again. You'll live to tell about this. I hate doing laundry, but I love clean sheets. Tell me more about that. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about changing my mind. Reading Adam Grant's book _Think Again_ changed the way I think about my career path, my interests, and my passions. I realize that I do not have to apologize for changing my mind; doing so does not make me a flip-flopper. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bringing awareness to the plight of university adjunct faculty whose teaching is the backbone at many reputable universities. 
- 📫 How to reach me
